# pimcore-tutorial-navigation

This repository only includes the partial script for the my bootstrap3 based navigation for my pimcore video tutorial on youtube: <https://youtu.be/Ar1QrCC0xrk>

It's based on the example code from the official pimcore documentation page at <https://www.pimcore.org/docs/latest/Documents/Navigation.html>

It's slightly improved but i did not put a lot of effort into this. So use it with caution :-)
